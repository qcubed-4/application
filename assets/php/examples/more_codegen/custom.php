		<h1>Implementing Custom Business Logic</h1>
		
		<p>Almost no application can be purely code-generated. As you develop your application, you will likely
		have to implement your own custom business rules and functionality.</p>
		
		<p>At the object level, these business rules can be implemented in the custom subclasses. In our
		example, we make up a fictional business rule of <strong>getPrice()</strong> for our <strong>Project</strong>. This <strong>getPrice()</strong>
		method takes in a "discount percentage" parameter, and uses it to recalculate the budget, incorporating the
		discount and adding 8.25% tax.</p>

		<p>Note how we can do this within the custom subclass. Any modifications we make in the custom
		subclass will never be overwritten on subsequent re-generations of the code.</p>
