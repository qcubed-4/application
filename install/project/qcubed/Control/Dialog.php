/**
 * Class Dialog
 *
 * Implements a Dialog.
 *
 * Dialogs are somewhat of a special control in the framework, in that the framework calls on dialogs and expects them
 * to do certain things. The dialog must implement the dialog interface, but the actual display of the dialog might
 * be dependent on what CSS or JavaScript framework.
 *
 * Here is where you choose what you want all the dialogs in your application to look like by extending this Dialog
 * class from the base class in your framework. The default uses JQuery UI's dialog, but there is a bootstrap plugin
 * available that implements dialogs through its Modal class. Other implementations may be developed in the future.
 *
 * There are a couple of ways to use the dialog. The simplest is as follows:
 *
 * From anywhere in your code:
 * <code>
 * $dlg = new Dialog($this, 'my-dialog');
 * $dlg->Text = 'Show this on the dialog.'
 * $dlg->AddButton ('OK', 'ok');
 * $dlg->AddAction (new DialogButton(), new Ajax('buttonClicked));
 * </code>
 *
 * @package QCubed\Project\Control

// If using the bootstrap library:
//class Dialog extends \QCubed\Bootstrap\Modal implements \QCubed\Control\DialogInterface
