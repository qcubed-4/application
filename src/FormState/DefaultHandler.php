/**
 * Class DefaultHandler
 * This is the default FormState handler, storing the base64 encoded session data
 * (and if requested by QForm, encrypted) as a hidden form variable on the page, itself. It is meant to be a "quick
 * and dirty" handler that works in limited situations.
 *
 * We recommend that you do NOT use this formstate handler in general. It sends the entire formstate back and forth
 * to the client browser on every server and ajax request, which is slow and could potentially reach limits quickly. It
 * encrypts the data, but there are still potential security problems if the data is sensitive.
 *
 * To change the formstate handler, define the FORM_STATE_HANDLER in your configuration.inc.php file. See that
 * file for more detail.
 *
 * This form state handler is NOT safe to use when making asynchronous AJAX calls. The reason is that since the entire
 * formstate is sent to the browser, each ajax call must wait for the return trip to get the new formstate before
 * sending the formstate back to the server on the next ajax call.
