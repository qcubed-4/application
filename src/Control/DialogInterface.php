/**
 * Interface DialogInterface
 *
 * Defines the publicly consumable api that the QCubed framework uses to interact with a dialog.
 *
 * More and more CSS and JavaScript frameworks are coming out with their own forms of dialog, which are usually a
 * combination of HTML tag(s), CSS and JavaScript widget. QCubed has many ways of potentially interacting with
 * dialogs, but to be able to inject a dialog into the framework, we need a consistent interface for all to use.
 *
 * This particular interface has been implemented in both JQuery UI dialogs and Bootstrap dialogs. As more needs arise,
 * we can modify the interface to accommodate as many frameworks as possible.
 *
 * Dialogs should descend from the Panel control. Dialogs should be able to be a member of a form or control object
 * and appear with an Open call, but they should also be able to be instantiated on the fly. The framework has hooks for
 * both, and if you are creating a dialog implementation, see the current JQuery UI and Bootstrap implementations for more
 * direction.
 *
 * Feel free to implement more than just the function listed. These are the minimal set to allow your dialog to be used
 * by the default QCubed framework.
