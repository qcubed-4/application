/**
 * Class ButtonBase
 *
 * Implements a JQuery UI Button
 *
 * The JqButtonBase class defined here provides an interface between the generated
 * QJqButtonGen class and QCubed. This file is part of the core and will be overwritten
 * when you update QCubed. To override, make your changes to the QJqButton.class.php file instead.
 *
 * Create a button exactly as if you were creating a QButton.
 *
 * @property boolean $ShowText Causes text to be shown when icons are also defined.
 *
 * One of the JqButtonGen properties uses the same names as standard QCubed properties.
 * The Text property is a boolean in the JqUi object that specifies whether
 * to show text or just icons (provided icons are defined), and the Label property overrides
 * the standard HTML of the button. Because of the name conflict, the JQ UI property is called
 * ->JqText. You can also use ShowText as an alias to this as well so that your code is more readable.
 *  Text = standard HTML text of button
 *  Label = override of a standard HTML text if you want a button to say something different when JS is on or off
 *  ShowText = whether or not to hide the text of the button when icons are set
