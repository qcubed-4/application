/**
 * Class AccordionActivate
 *
 * The abstract AccordionActivate class defined here is
 * code-generated. The code to generate this file is
 * in the /tools/jquery_ui_gen/jq_control_gen.php file,
 * and you can regenerate the files if you need to.
 *
 * The comments in this file are taken from the api reference site, so they do
 * not always make sense with regard to QCubed. They are simply provided
 * as reference.
 * Triggered after a panel has been activated (after the animation
 * completes). If the accordion was previously collapsed, ui.oldHeader
 * and ui.oldPanel will be empty jQuery objects. If the accordion is
 * collapsing, ui.newHeader and ui.newPanel will be empty jQuery objects.
 * Note: Since the activated event is only fired on panel activation, it
 * is not fired for the initial panel when the accordion widget is
 * created. If you need a hook for widget creation, use the creation event.
 * 
 * 	* event Type: Event 
 * 
 * 	* ui Type: Object 
 * 
 * 	* newHeader Type: jQuery The header that was just activated.
 * 	* oldHeader Type: jQuery The header that was just deactivated.
 * 	* newPanel Type: jQuery The panel that was just activated.
 * 	* oldPanel Type: jQuery The panel that was just deactivated.
